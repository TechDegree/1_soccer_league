Dear Bill and Hillary Stein, 

We would like to welcome Kimmy Stein to the Dragons. Our first practice will be at 11:20 AM on Thursday, March 9 at Yellow Boats United. We are looking forward to having Kimmy with us, and hope to celebrate a successful 2018 season together.

Best Regards,
Dragons team

Dear Wendy and Mike Gordon, 

We would like to welcome Eva Gordon to the Raptors. Our first practice will be at 09:15 AM on Wednesday, March 2 at Orange Monsters University.
We are looking forward to having Eva with us, and hope to celebrate a successful 2018 season together.

Best Regards,
Raptors
Dima Kailar, Head Coach

Dear Robin and Sarika Soto, 

We would like to welcome Diego Soto to the Sharks. Our first practice will be at 10:00 AM on Monday, March 6 at Green Dragon Venue.
We are looking forward to having Diego with us, and hope to celebrate a successful 2018 season together.

Best Regards,
Sharks
Juliana Yandar, Head Coach

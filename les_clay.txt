Dear Wynonna Brown, 

We would like to welcome Les Clay to the Raptors. Our first practice will be at 09:15 AM on Wednesday, March 2 at Orange Monsters University. We are looking forward to having Les with us, and hope to celebrate a successful 2018 season together.

Best Regards,
Raptors team
Dima Kailar, Head Coach

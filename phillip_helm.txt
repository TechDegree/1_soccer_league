Dear Thomas Helm and Eva Jones, 

We would like to welcome Phillip Helm to the Raptors. Our first practice will be at 09:15 AM on Wednesday, March 2 at Orange Monsters University. We are looking forward to having Phillip with us, and hope to celebrate a successful 2018 season together.

Best Regards,
Raptors team

Dear Thomas Helm and Eva Jones, 

We would like to welcome Phillip Helm to the Dragons. Our first practice will be at 11:20 AM on Thursday, March 9 at Yellow Boats United.
We are looking forward to having Phillip with us, and hope to celebrate a successful 2018 season together.

Best Regards,
Dragons

Dear Thomas Helm and Eva Jones, 

We would like to welcome Phillip Helm to the Sharks. Our first practice will be at 10:00 AM on Monday, March 6 at Green Dragon Venue. We are looking forward to having Phillip with us, and hope to celebrate a successful 2018 season together.

Best Regards,
Sharks team
